/*
given an nxn matrix, write a method to rotate it 90 degrees.

can you do it in place?
*/


// make a structure that is a slice of slices



//rotate clockwise

// make a new empty set of slices (one empty for each original ith col)

// iterate through the reversed i, forward j positions

// to the new column eqaul to the old jth row, append the original i,j position

// essentially starting the columns sideways and then appeanding the data
// moving from bottom right to top left

// take the i, j coordinates of the matrix
