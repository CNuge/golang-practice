# Cam's golang practice

I have recently disovered go and am really excited about the potential of this programming language. I have been working through the golang tutorial and I am also attempting some small programming problems to help me learn the syntax and design patterns needed to work effecticely in go. 
Hopefully in the near future I will be in a position to progress to solving some more complex problems with go.
