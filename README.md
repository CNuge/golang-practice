# Cam's golang practice

I have recently disovered go and am really excited about the potential of this programming language. I have been working through the golang tutorial and I am also attempting some small programming problems to help me learn the syntax and design patterns needed to work effecticely in go. 
Hopefully in the near future I will be in a position to progress to solving some more complex problems with go.


Inspiration for the problems comes from:

- [cracking the coding interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)
- [exercism](http-//exercism.io/languages/go/exercises)
- [the golang tour](https://tour.golang.org/)
- the bioinformatics ones I'm making up off the top of my head

If you're reading this and better at go than I am, I'd love feedback. I'm just starting with the language but I would like to hear how I can improve!
